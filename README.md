# vim-config

My NeoVim configuration and installation instructions so I don't lose them ever again! Is mostly based off of Ben Awad's configuration, but that may not be the case forever.

### Copilot

Remember to install Copilot by cloning the [repository](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim)!

### Telescope

You need to install fd for Telescope to work properly.
